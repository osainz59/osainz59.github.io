    <h3><a href="" class="fas fa-address-card"></a> About me</h3>
    <p>I was born in Donosti, a beautiful city and the capital of Gipuzkoa, Basque Country. I studied Computer Science bachelor and the Language Analyzing and Processing master at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU).
        Meanwhile, I worked as an internship on IXA group, where I developed my bachelor and masters thesis, both related to Relation Extraction and data-augmentation techniques. Both thesis were accepted on international conferences,
        the first one on LREC2020 and the second on IberLEF2020.
    </p>
    <p>On my free time I like to watch series and movies, if possible in original audio. Actually I speak natively Spanish and Basque, I do my best effort with English and also I'm learning Japanese in a self-taught way.
        That's why one of the plans I have in mind is to travel to Japan and learn about their culture.

    <h3><a href="" class="fas fa-drafting-compass black-text"></a> Experience & Skills</h3>
    <p>As my area of intereset is the Artificial Inteligence I have some years of experience on traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
        Actually I have been mainly using Python for more than 4 years, which is the most popular programming language for data analysis task right now.
        I prefer PyTorch over Tensorflow, but I'm not afraid of using any of them. I have been using state-of-the-art systems like Flair or Transformers for a while,
        and also I adapted them to shared tasks such us <a href="">eHealth-KD 2020</a> which I have won the subtask of my iterest. 

        <p>If you want to see some of my recent works I listed my featured projects in the following section, but you can check all of them in the <a href="">Projects</a> page.</p>
