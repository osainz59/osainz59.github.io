    <h3><a href="" class="fas fa-address-card"></a> About me</h3>
    <p>I was born in Donosti, a beautiful city and the capital of Gipuzkoa, Basque Country. I studied Computer Science
        bachelor and the Language Analyzing and Processing master at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU).
        Meanwhile, I worked as an internship on IXA group, where I developed my bachelor and masters thesis, both
        related to Relation Extraction and data-augmentation techniques. Both thesis were accepted on international
        conferences, the first one on LREC2020 and the second on IberLEF2020. Actually im doing a Ph.D on low-resource
        Information Extraction at IXA Research group.

    <h3><a href="" class="fas fa-drafting-compass black-text"></a> Experience & Skills</h3>
    <p>As my area of intereset is the Artificial Inteligence I have some years of experience on traditional Machine
        Learning and Deep Learning.
        Actually I have been mainly using Python for more than 4 years, which is the most popular programming language
        for data analysis task right now.
        I prefer PyTorch over Tensorflow, but I'm not afraid of using any of them. I have been using state-of-the-art
        systems like Flair or Transformers for a while.

    <p>If you want to see some of my recent works I listed my featured projects in the following section, but you can
        check all of them in the <a href="">Projects</a> page.</p>
